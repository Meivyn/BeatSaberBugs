# Beat Saber Community Bug Tracker

This issue tracker is used by the Beat Saber modding community to document bugs for Beat Games with a chance of getting them looked at.

There are no guarantees that issues reported here will be fixed, but Beat Games is looking at the list and will triage issues according to their priorities and schedules.

To improve visibility for the development team issues should additionally be reported as usual through social media with a brief summary and a link to a ticket created here copied into the report. Bug reports submitted here should - where possible - include a minimal reproducible test case either as an attached mod or an in-line code snippet, and steps to reproduce the issue.
